   - Check the "Use Gemini API" option
   - Paste your API key in the field provided
   - Click "Test API Connection" to verify it works
   - Select your preferred API usage level:
     - **Minimal**: Uses API sparingly (saves API calls)
     - **Balanced**: Moderate API usage
     - **Extensive**: Frequent API calls for more dynamic content

3. **Troubleshooting API Connection**
   - Ensure your API key is entered correctly (no extra spaces)
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify you haven't exceeded API rate limits
   - Try refreshing the page and re-entering your key
