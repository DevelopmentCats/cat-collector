## Known Limitations

1. **Browser Compatibility**: The game is optimized for modern browsers (Chrome 80+, Firefox 75+, Safari 13+, Edge 80+). Older browsers may experience display or functionality issues.

2. **API Dependency**: When using the Gemini API integration:
   - Requires internet connection
   - Subject to API rate limits
   - Dependent on Google's service availability

3. **Local Storage**: Game saves use browser local storage, which:
   - Is limited to the browser where the game was saved
   - May be cleared if browser data is purged
   - Has size limitations (typically 5-10MB per domain)

## Future Improvement Opportunities

1. **Offline Mode**: Enhance the fallback content generation when API is unavailable
2. **Cross-Device Saving**: Implement cloud save functionality
3. **Expanded Content**: Add more locations, human types, and items
4. **Accessibility**: Improve screen reader support and keyboard navigation
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Further enhance the mobile experience
